Well we all have been working in Open Source and committing various Pull requests and issues. Many a times it may happen that a mentor is unable to manage all these activities. So This project is about tracking the contributor as well as its contribution by respective mentors.


CodeBadge is a project which takes official GitHub API into consideration and makes a fading badges graph for each organization. This project would be organization-oriented project i.e. each organization will need to serve it on a reserved route, say /codebadge. For eg: If coala wants to integrate CodeBadge, they‚Äôll serve this project on coala.io/codebadge. Our aim is to make CodeBadge as a standard such that people start using it as a measure in order to test their skill level/track their progress in a specific community. For eg, Competitive Coding guys test their skills by asking each other what‚Äôs their rank on HackerRank / HackerEarth! Likewise, open-source contributors should start asking, **Hey! What badge did you recently earned on CodeBadge!**

### Why do we need CodeBadge?
- To track and incorporate contributors‚Äô progress in the community or community‚Äôs progress as a whole. Making a one-stop platform to find each contributor‚Äôs progress rather than finding it separately for each contributor.
- To show the progress by awarding some really cool badges to top contributors in order to keep them connected towards the community.
- Auto-assign related issues to most active contributors using tagging to keep contributors connected.


### Features
The other part of this project includes the ‚Äúnotifying moderator‚Äù since we see sometimes that there are many PRs being sent, or issues being opened by various people across the globe but there are limited numbers of maintainers merging the PRs. This way organizations usually lose their potential contributors due to following things:

- Their PRs are not being merged
- They find difficulty in understanding the issue
- Contributors finding difficulty in understanding the issue
- They could not reach to expectation
  So this will help the maintainers get notified when they see these people inactive.

- GitHub Heatmaps are for each person‚Äôs profile and can be observed from visiting each contributor‚Äôs profile specifically. Whereas, our aim is to show a complete fading graph for an organization, which would hence be capable of showing each contributor‚Äôs progress as well.
- There would be some pre-built badges by us as well as we offer the organization to design their own badges. This can be done by the illustrator which we are developing for this project.
- Pre-defined badges could be based on some achievement levels like Baby-Steps, Not-a-Newbie, Almost-Pro, Legendary-Committer, etc which could be awarded by setting some convention like a number of merged PRs or difficulty of issues resolved by the person.
- Creating/Integrating a bot with our platform which would auto-assign/auto-suggest related issues to the top-most active contributors of the community on the basis of tagging, like what their recent PRs were based upon.
- Admin Dashboard creation which would show notifications/cards for whosoever earned any new badge. Community Admins should have some extra privileges to award any extra badge to an extraordinary contributor say Committer-of-the-Month, Top-Contributor, GOAT(Greatest-of-all-Times), etc manually.
- The illustrator will provide the user with an interface which will help the organization to design their own badges. It has a special feature of making a sketch outline of any image which is uploaded. Once a template is uploaded by any user it will also be available to be used by other organizations. It will also provide a feature to make a shareable interface so that more than one person of an organization can work on the same badge at the same time.


## How does it work

For instance, suppose a contributor ‚ÄúX‚Äù has been quite active within the community by working on various PRs, opening and resolving various issues, active on chat channels but after a month ‚ÄúX‚Äù gets disappeared. So by using this dashboard they will have a badge interface. There will be a badge attached in front of the name of the contributor. This badge will have a unique color so as time passes (a day, 1 week, 2 weeks, a month, etc) this badges will keep on fading. Every fade color will have a unique reason. For example, when a contributor made a PR, the badge appeared ‚ÄúRed‚Äù in color. This badge will remain in the same color as long as he/she is contributing. If that contributor stops contributing and has not contributed for a week so his badge will become green in color. And this will notify maintainers or admins about their disappearance. This way the organizations will have greater eye on the contributors and can help them maintain their community.

## Setting up the project
To set up the project, carry out the following steps:

**Step 1:-** fork the repository

**Step 2:-** clone the repository

``` git clone https://github.com/username/Codebadge.git ``` 

- Remember to replace "username" with your github username in the link above

- Create an [oAuth](https://github.com/settings/developers) application if you haven't already

- Make sure that the callback-url is set to `http://localhost:8080/#/auth`

- Make an `.env` file in the root folder of the project (where package.json is)

- Add the code given below and replace it with values from your oAuth application:
```
VUE_APP_CLIENT_ID=<client id>
VUE_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=<client secret>
```
**Step 3:-** install frontend dependencies and run frontend server
``` npm install && npm run serve```

**Step 4:-** install flask api dependencies and run api
``` 
cd backend
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
FLASK_APP=run.py flask run
```

## Stack used
Codebadge has a dashboard, where these badges are placed. Any stack could be used but since the organizations have fixed stacks its better to stick with Nodejs, Vue, and React.

## Benefits to the community


Different communities or programs like GirlScript Summer of Code, Codeheat, GSOC, etc would be able to track their contributors and this project will help them by not losing potential contributors and select the best from all potential candidates.

## Contributions Best Practices

**Commits**

- Write clear meaningful git commit messages (Do read http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
- Make sure your PR's description contains GitHub's special keyword references that automatically close the related issue when the PR is merged. (More info at https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests )
- When you make very very minor changes to a PR of yours (like for example fixing a failing Travis build or some small style corrections or minor changes requested by reviewers) make sure you squash your commits afterward so that you don't have an absurd number of commits for a very small fix. (Learn how to squash at https://davidwalsh.name/squash-commits-git )
- When you're submitting a PR for a UI-related issue, it would be really awesome if you add a screenshot of your change or a link to a deployment where it can be tested out along with your PR. It makes it very easy for the reviewers and you'll also get reviews quicker.
